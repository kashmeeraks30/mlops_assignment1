The comparison is performed based on Mean Square Error(MSE) and R square before and after applying the hyperparameter tuning. CI/CI pipeline is automated using GitHub Actions and is triggered with every push operation. Usage: Checkout the code and run the following: pip install -r requirements.txt python regression.py
